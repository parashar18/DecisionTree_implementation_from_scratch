# DecisionTree_implementation_from_scratch
Implemented the decision tree learning algorithm using </br>
1] Information gain heuristic </br>
2] Variance impurity heuristic 

Also implemented depth-based pruning by using maximum depth dmax as a hyper-parameter, from the following set: {5,10,15,20,50,100} and return best results. 

To Run code: </br>
python Decision_tree.py train validate test method pruning

train= path of a training data set
validate= path of a validation data set
test= path of a testing data set
method= "Entropy" or "Variance"
pruning= "0" for no pruning OR "preprune" for depth based pruning
